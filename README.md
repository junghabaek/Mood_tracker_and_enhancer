# Mood_tracker_and_enhancer (Spring boot)
# Project Description

## Objectives:
1. to help users feel better by being more active according to the current state of mind.
2. users can keep track of their past days' mood which can give them objective information about their mood.

## Technologies:
1. Spring security - only authorized users are able to access and modify information.
2. OAuth 2.0 - to delegate authentication and authorization to google and naver.
3. JPA and MariaDB - to store and modify data in a relational database.

## Challenges:
1. Spring security - underlying concepts were not difficult, but quite a lot and understanding as a whole took some time.
2. Building screens - as a server engineer, building even simple pages were new to me and this became the motivation to learn flutter.
3. design pattern - honestly, I did not see the point of creating data transfer object and value objects in the first place. Same with the Service
